# pc/blender-serial
Blender-serial uses the Pyserial python module. If you already have it on your machine you can already use our scripts.
Otherwise you need to clone locally the github repo of pyserial. This is the command:

git clone https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial

Run the command in this directory, that's where outs scripts will look for the pyserial folder
